#ConveyorBeltCapacityCheck

My second assignment for my C programming course.

Checks if a user chosen number of conveyor belt motor can carry a user chosen package weight (in kg), by comparing the number of motors with the max kg load of each motor multiplied by the number of motors, with the chosen weight. It then prints whether or not the conveyor belt can carry the packages. The while loop allows the user to repeat the program.
